* I2C driver for Critical Link SOC FPGA SPI Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "cl,i2c-1.0".
- reg : Contains one entry, which is a tuple consisting of a
	physical address and length.  The entry is the address and
	length of the controller register set.
- interrupts : Unit interrupt specifier for the controller interrupt.
- master-ref-clk : Specifies the frequency of the controller input clock.
- clk-frequency : The requested frequency of SCL

Example:

		i2c5: i2c@ff230000 {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "cl,i2c-1.0";
			reg = <0xff230000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0 159 4>;
			status = "okay";

			clk-frequency = <100000>;
			master-ref-clk = <50000000>;
		};
